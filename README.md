### README: Shodan Vulnerable Services Scanner

This script leverages the Shodan API to scan for vulnerable services by executing specific search queries. The output is saved in a structured CSV format, allowing users to easily analyze the results.

---

#### Requirements

1. **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. **Shodan API Key**: Sign up for a Shodan account and obtain an API key from [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/).
3. **Python Libraries**:
   - **shodan**: Shodan API wrapper for Python.
   - **requests**: For making HTTP requests if needed in future modifications.
   - **pandas**: For data handling and saving results to CSV.
   - **time**: (Included in Python Standard Library)

   You can install the required libraries using the following:
   ```bash
   pip install shodan requests pandas
   ```

#### Setup

1. **Clone or Download the Script**:
   - Save the script to your desired location, e.g., `shodan_scan.py`.

2. **Configure the Shodan API Key**:
   - Replace `'here_your_api_key_from_shodan'` in the script with your actual Shodan API key:
     ```python
     SHODAN_API_KEY = 'your_actual_api_key_here'
     ```

---

#### Usage

1. **Running the Script**:
   - Execute the script in the terminal:
     ```bash
     python shodan_scan.py
     ```
   - The script will search for vulnerable services using predefined queries, storing the output in a CSV file named `vulnerable_services.csv`.

2. **Modifying Queries**:
   - Update the `queries` list in the script with any additional search terms to customize the scan:
     ```python
     queries = ["ftp anonymous", 'port:9200 "elastic"', 'http.title:"robots.txt" port:80']
     ```

---

#### Output

- **CSV File**: `vulnerable_services.csv` containing:
  - **IP**: IP address of the vulnerable service
  - **Port**: Open port of the service
  - **Org**: Organization name if available
  - **Location**: City and Country of the service
  - **Query**: The search query used
  - **Timestamp**: When the data was last updated

---

#### Notes

- **API Limits**: Shodan free accounts may have limitations. Consider upgrading if you require higher rate limits or additional features.
- **Error Handling**: The script includes basic error handling for API errors.
- **Data Privacy**: Handle data carefully as results may expose sensitive information.
